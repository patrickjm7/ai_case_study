# NVIDIA
The engine of AI




## Overview and Origin

Nvidia Corporation was founded on April 5, 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in Sunnyvale, California.

Originally founded to build Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to improve the graphics in video games, Nvidia only entered the AI industry after identifying the potential of its GPUs for AI. Because GPUs perform multiple calculations simultaneously, as opposed to sequentially like standard computer chips, they are well suited to power the complex computing required in the training of AI models. 

Sales of Nvidia GPUs continue to be its primary source of revenue though it has received funding through venture capital and government contracts including a 20 million dollar investment at its founding. The company has since increased its market value by over 3 trillion dollars currently making it the most valuable company in the world.  


## Business Activities

Nvidias goal in the AI space is to more efficiently power the complex level of computing required by AI systems through its GPUs and software frameworks.  

While Nvidia does not directly disclose who its biggest customer is, large tech companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft are believed to make up around 40% of its revenue. Nvidia also include many AI startups such as OpenAI and autonomous driving companies amongst its growing customer base. 

Estimates predict that Nvidia controls around 70% to 95% of the AI chip market meaning that any company currently investing in AI is probably a customer. Its early success in developing GPUs for the video game industry has given Nvidia a head start over its competition, one factor in leading to its market dominance. Another factor as believed by New Street Research is the full-stack and system-scaling integration abilities not offered by its competitors.

In addition to its GPU hardware, Nvidia also provides the software platform CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), which leverages the power of the GPU for use in general computing such as machine learning, image processing and numerical analytics.  


## Landscape 

The introduction of CUDA by Nvidia in 2006 unlocked GPUs for general purpose computing allowing its multi core technology to be used for non graphical tasks. This encouraged the adoption of GPUs by other industries, becoming the standard to power data centers and later crypto mining operations and Artificial Intelligence. With so many fields utilizing GPU technology, innovation to improve their design and architecture grew. In 2012 and 2014 Nvidia introduced new system architectures named Kepler and Maxwell which increased both performance and energy efficiency, important for mobile and data center applications. In 2017 Tensor Core technology was introduced by Nvidia to further increase the GPUs performance specifically for AI.

Broadly speaking, Nvidia belongs to the Information Technology sector, but more specifically it is a software and fabless company. Currently, Alphabet, AMD, Apple, Amazon and Intel to name a few are all designing and building AI specific chips to compete with Nvidia.


## Results

Nvidia has long been a leader in the AI field. Inventing the first GPU and identifying its potential to be used in AI laid the groundwork for every other company using AI. With approximately 80% of the world's AI running on Nvidia GPUs, and a current market value of 3.35 trillion USD, Nvidia has become the backbone of AI. In their own words "Nvidia is the engine of AI".


## Recommendations

Nvidias GPU lead them to dominate the AI field but advancements in ARM chips by competing companies may one day out perform the GPU in AI related tasks. Investing in this technology while still ahead of the market would help to ensure Nvidia continues to lead the AI revolution well into the future.
